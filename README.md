# extended-phase-graph

This program is for the generation and the investigation of the Extended Phase Graph (EPG) for a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) multi-spin-echo pulse sequence. The program is developed based on the paper "Extended phase graphs: Dephasing, RF pulses, and echoes - pure and simple" by M. Weigel (http://doi.org/10.1002/jmri.24619).

Given the parameters such as flip angle, initial phase and time-position of the RF pulses, the complex magnetization is calculated for each of the dephasing, rephasing and stored pathways. Each pathway is then drawn on the phase diagram.
